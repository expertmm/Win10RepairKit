# Win10RepairKit
So far fixes tile cache for a logged out profile (using a third clean profile) as per a set of online instructions that works when other methods failed

Before using this program, try:
	* right-click Windows menu
	* Run
	* WSReset.exe
	* Restart computer
If still fails, try this program (see steps below)

## Installation
* Make two new admin user profiles on Windows 10 (second one may not be needed since now this program comes with a clean database)
* Log into each of them then logout
* Restart the computer

## Usage
* Login as one of the new user profiles and run this program (Win10RepairKit in bin folder)
